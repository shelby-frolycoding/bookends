## MVP / Post MVP:


## MVP

- Connect to Airtable API
- Pull info and render data from api
- Add 8 components: title/author, completion input, rating input, add a book, remove a book, home/nav, 


## PMVP:

- Create a Bookclub where multiple users can share reading tracking/ thread discussion
- Components: add bookbuddy, remove bookbuddy, add club book, thread discussion.

^^ May be over ambitious ^^ 

- Maybe a share to social media button on each book tracking?

### SWOT Analysis:

## Strengths:

Styling, UI, Formatting, organizing app

## Weaknesses:

the actually functionality, link/routing, too many components will confuse me
mobile first design

## Opportunities:
make this very practical, user-friendly

## Threats:
time, burn-out
